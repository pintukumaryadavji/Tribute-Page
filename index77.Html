                than thirty years before that enchanting Saturday night when Ravi Shastri’s voice rang through television
                sets all over India, when even the spunky and exuberant Indian youth showed more interest in an old-school
                CRT television at a local chai ki dukaan than the dance-floor at a pub, a pump-operator in Ranchi awaited the
                birth of his third child.
                'Dhoniiiii finishes off in style. A magnificent strike into the crowd. India lift the World Cup after 28 years.
                The party's started in the dressing room. And it’s an Indian captain, who’s been absolutely magnificent, in the night
                of the final.’
                Any cricket fan worth his salt just read this in Ravi Shastri's most dramatic voice, as Mahendra Singh Dhoni enchanted the
                Wankhede on the night of 2nd April 2011.
                The Foundations
                Transition Period - A rebuilding phase
                 Mumbai, Dhoni led CSK to their 4th title in 2021. Dhoni stepped down from CSK captaincy but he got it back from Ravindra Jadeja after a disastrous 2022 season which saw them not qualify for the playoffs. Dhoni will be back for the 2023 season and will captain the side.
