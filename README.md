## 🧠 What I Learned

* How to structure a performant and accessible HTML layout

* Best practices for GitHub deployment and README documentation

---

## 🎨 Suggestions for Improvement

* Add more robust **responsiveness** using CSS framework or Flexbox/Grid
* Refactor redundant or unused CSS for cleaner code
* Use pseudo-elements or background-image opacity techniques to overlay text without affecting readability ([reddit.com][1], [github.com][2], [github.com][3], [reddit.com][4], [reddit.com][5], [freecodecamp.org][6])
* Consider enhancing accessibility and SEO (proper heading levels, ARIA labels)
